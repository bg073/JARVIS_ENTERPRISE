# 1) Smart Access

**What is this feature**
Role-based “just-enough” access provisioning + automated deprovision on exit. Enforces least-privilege across apps, files, infra.

**Models & systems**

* Identity & Access Management (IAM) core: OIDC/SAML provider, RBAC + ABAC engine.
* Policy engine: rule-based policy server (Rego / Open Policy Agent).
* Risk scoring model: supervised classifier (Gradient Boosting / LightGBM or small transformer-based risk scorer) that predicts access risk by user-role-behavior.
* Access recommendation model: recommendation system (matrix factorization or embeddings + nearest-neighbor) to suggest minimal permissions.
* Audit & ledger: append-only event store (immutable logs) + SIEM integration.
* Metadata store: user/role graph DB (Neo4j or Property Graph), attribute store (LDAP / HRIS sync).
* Automation layer: orchestration (workflow engine like Airflow/Temporal) + connectors to SaaS APIs (Okta, Azure AD, AWS IAM, GSuite, Slack, GitHub).

**How they work (data flow & synthesis)**

1. HR system (HRIS) creates/updates user profiles → event enters message bus (Kafka).
2. Policy engine consults role templates + skill/assignment metadata in graph DB.
3. Recommendation model proposes least-permission set; admin or automated policy approves.
4. IAM provisioning API grants access; all actions logged to event store.
5. Risk model consumes login, device, and behavioral telemetry (from Threat Sentinel) to flag anomalous privileges for revocation.
6. On exit, HR event triggers automated deprovision workflow; confirmations logged.

**Where they report & reside**

* Models: hosted in MLOps infra (containerized on Kubernetes in a secure VPC).
* Data: HRIS & user graph in private DBs (on-prem or cloud with private subnet).
* Reports: Admin dashboard (IAM console), SIEM alerts, compliance exports (CSV/PDF), periodic role-usage reports to Security & HR.

**How to mitigate risk / controls**

* Enforce separation of duties: Rego policies + human approval gates for high-risk roles.
* Immutable audit logs with cryptographic signing.
* Fine-grained RBAC for who can change policies (only CISO delegates).
* Model explainability: each recommendation includes top-N reasons (feature contributions).
* Canary deployments for model changes + rollout safeguards.
* Regular access review workflows & scheduled attestation.
* Data minimization: only store attributes needed for decisions; retention policy enforced.

**Complexity**
Medium → High (depends on number of target systems and legacy connectors).

**Who controls / modifies**

* Owner: CISO (policy & risk), CHRO (role templates & HR sync), IAM Engineer (ops).
* Model changes authorized by MLOps team + Security/HR sign-off via change control.

**Users**
HR admins, IT/Security ops, hiring managers, audit/compliance officers.

**Outputs**

* Provisioning events, risk flags, attestation reports, recommended permission bundles with explainability notes.

# 2) AI Interviewer + Question Coach

**What is this feature**
Real-time/recorded interview analysis: scores candidate against role competencies, summarizes answers, **suggests follow-up questions** for interviewers.

**Models & systems**

* ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition): robust speech-to-text (hybrid model or cloud STT with custom vocab).
* Speaker diarization & PII redaction pipeline.
* Large Language Model (LLM) for comprehension & summarization (instruction-tuned transformer).
* Classification models: skill-match classifiers (fine-tuned transformer or logistic regression over embeddings).
* Question-suggester: retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) using a skills/tasks knowledge base + LLM prompt templates.
* Scoring & bias detection module: fairness checks (statistical tests, bias detectors).
* Interview metadata store: secure blob store for recordings, vector DB for embeddings (Pinecone / Milvus / open-source).

**How they work**

1. Audio captured → ASR → timestamped transcript with speaker segments.
2. Transcripts → embedding + vector DB. LLM generates concise summary and extracts competency evidence (work examples, behavioral indicators).
3. Skill-match classifier compares responses to job competency profile and produces a match score and confidence interval.
4. Question-suggester pulls role-specific probes from knowledge base plus context from earlier answers to surface smart follow-ups (e.g., ask about a specific technology they mentioned).
5. Bias-checker runs on outputs to detect demographic or linguistic bias before reports delivered to HR.

**Where they report & reside**

* Models in secure model serving infra (Kubernetes), transcripts in encrypted storage.
* Reporting: HR dashboard with candidate card (score, summary, suggested follow-ups, red flags).
* Audit logs: stored for hiring compliance and to support appeals.

**Risk mitigation & controls**

* Human-in-the-loop required: scores and suggested questions are advisory — a human reviewer must approve hiring decisions.
* Bias mitigation: fairness constraints during training; regular audits and demographic parity monitoring.
* PII handling: redact SSNs/phone numbers in transcripts; enforce retention and deletion policies.
* Consent: candidate consent flow & compliance to local hiring laws.
* Explainability: provide reasoned evidence for each score (quote snippets + features).
* Model governance: model lineage, CI/CD with A/B tests and rollback.

**Complexity**
Medium (ASR + LLM integration + compliance layers).

**Who controls / modifies**

* Owner: Head of Talent / CHRO (rules & hiring rubric).
* MLOps + Data Privacy Officer control model retraining & data retention.
* Interviewers get edit rights to suggested questions in-session.

**Users**
Interviewers, recruiting coordinators, hiring managers, talent ops.

**Outputs**
Candidate summaries, match scores, question suggestions, bias & fairness logs.

2. Anomaly detector flags sessions with unusual features (midnight login from new country + new device + sudden privilege escalate).
3. Correlation engine enriches with user profile and risk history; computes composite risk score.
4. If above threshold, SOAR executes playbook: stepwise containment (step 1: MFA challenge, step 2: session termination, step 3: temporary account suspension and ticket to IT).
5. All actions logged and sent to CISO dashboard and incident response queue.

**Where they report & reside**

* Detection models in secure cloud region or on-prem security cluster.
* Alerts to Security Ops console, ticketing system (Jira Service Desk), and executive daily digest.
* Forensic data stored in WORM or SIEM with retention policy.

* Playbook granularity: avoid full auto-suspension for borderline anomalies — use progressive steps.
* Red team testing & regular pen tests.
* Explainability: attach top contributing signals to each alert to reduce false positives.
* Access to SOAR actions gated by role & approval workflows for high-impact actions.
* Logging and audit trail for every automated action for compliance review.
* Model retraining only via controlled pipelines, with canary & human approval.

2. Normalize events into a work timeline per user.
3. KPI engine maps activities to goals and computes attainment.
4. Duplicate-work detector raises flags when multiple users produce near-identical outputs on unrelated tasks.
5. Moonlighting heuristics: detect conflicting timelines (e.g., simultaneous work on two unrelated company projects), external domains, or highly repeated low-value tasks; produce a risk score.
6. Outputs are presented as aggregate team scores and individual coaching signals — not punitive logs.

**Where they report & reside**

* Analytics and model infra in secure cloud; aggregated dashboards for managers.
